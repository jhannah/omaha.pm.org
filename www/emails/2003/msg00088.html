***Head First Java
Order Number: 4656
You've never seen an O'Reilly book (or any other book, for that matter)
like &quot;Head First Java.&quot; Learning well and at a deep level takes a lot
more than reading text on a page. Actively combining words and pictures
helps in both understanding a subject and remembering it. &quot;Head First
Java&quot; puts these ideas into practice with mind-stretching exercises,
memorable analogies, and stories, humor, and attitude that aren't
pasted-on distractions--they drive home key points and make ideas come
alive. The Head First approach is as effective as it is unique.
<a  href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/hfjava/">http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/hfjava/</a>

Excerpts on &quot;A Trip to Objectville&quot; and &quot;Serious Polymorphism&quot; are

them there, and so should you.&quot;

***Adventures with Kerberos, CVS, and GSS-API
One of the difficulties of writing about technology is exploring the
dark corners where no one's ever been before. Jennifer Vesperman
recently tried to make her CVS installation use Kerberos
authentication. In this article she describes how she went about
integrating the two.

***Apple and Linux: A Mutual Friendship?
Is running a Linux distro on Mac hardware just sick? Why do people do
it? O'Reilly's editors talk about the benefits of, and pitfalls in,
running Linux on Mac OS X, in the latest &quot;From the Editors List.&quot;
<a  href="http://www.oreilly.com/pub/a/oreilly/editors/apple_linux_0503.html">http://www.oreilly.com/pub/a/oreilly/editors/apple_linux_0503.html</a>

***JBoss Optimizations 101
&quot;First make it work, then make it fast.&quot; Your J2EE application works,
but it's slower than you'd like under peak load. Before you rush out
for new hardware, check out your configuration. Sacha Labourey and Juha
Lindfors demonstrate a few simple techniques to improve JBoss
performance without spending money.

***Using Calculated DataColumns in ADO.NET
If you have a background in database work, you have undoubtedly run
into the rules of normalization. But even though ADO.NET's DataSet
class is sometimes described as a &quot;relational database in memory,&quot; it's
important to remember that there are differences between databases and
DataSets. In this particular case, the DataSets are designed to manage
calculated columns. In this article Mike Gunderloy will show you the
syntax for building calculated columns in your own DataSets, and
discuss some of the pros and cons of using such columns.

combination is AppleScript and Photoshop. Here's a tutorial on how to
automate iPhoto 2, complete with downloadable scripts.&quot;
