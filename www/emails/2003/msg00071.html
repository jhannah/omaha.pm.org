Interesting. I wonder how many lines of source would be considered an
&quot;extremely large program&quot;...?

I'm a 3rd generation language junky. I've never had the patience for C
and the like. I've never really been intererested in, or had an employer
who wanted me to work on &quot;low level&quot; development. As such, Perl has always
served me extremely well among its 3rd generation peer set.

I wonder if MS C# is considered 3rd generation? It's all OO nowadays...

Question:
When shouldn't I program in Perl?

    When your manager forbids it -- but do consider replacing them :-).

    Actually, one good reason is when you already have an existing
    application written in another language that's all done (and done
    well), or you have an application language specifically designed
    for a certain task (e.g. prolog, make).

    For various reasons, Perl is probably not well-suited for real-time
    embedded systems, low-level operating systems development work like
    device drivers or context-switching code, complex multithreaded
    shared-memory applications, or extremely large applications. You'll
    notice that perl is not itself written in Perl.

    The new native-code compiler for Perl may reduce the limitations
    given in the previous statement to some degree, but understand that
    Perl remains fundamentally a dynamically typed language, and not a
    statically typed one. You certainly won't be chastized if you don't
    trust nuclear-plant or brain-surgery monitoring code to it. And
    Larry will sleep easier, too -- Wall Street programs not
    withstanding. :-)

CREDITS
   When I first began the Perl FAQ in the late 80s, I never realized it
   would have grown to over a hundred pages, nor that Perl would ever
   become so popular and widespread. This document could not have been
   written without the tremendous help provided by Larry Wall and the
   rest of the Perl Porters.
