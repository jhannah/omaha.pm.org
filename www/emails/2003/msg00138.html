Nearly all attacks on computer systems have one fundamental cause:

allow all too easy access for attackers. This book looks at the problem
of bad code in a new way. Packed with advice based on decades of
experience in computer security, &quot;Secure Coding&quot; explains why so much
code today is filled with vulnerabilities, and tells readers what they
must do to avoid exploitation by attackers.

Safari News
================================================
***&quot;Go On Safari&quot; Tip of the Week Winner--Tony King, Chicago.pm
&quot;I just signed-up for Safari a couple of days ago as they are having a
free 14-day trial offer. I've been reviewing it for my office and it's
a very good reference tool. While I wouldn't want to read a whole book
online, it beats the price of having to purchase those books
individually and having that many technical books at the click of a
mouse can't be beat.&quot;

Your group can also participate in this introductory program just for
user group members. To &quot;Go on Safari,&quot; any of your members who sign up
for our Safari 14-day free trial can send comments on their
experiences, or tips and tricks for how they used Safari  (it only
needs to be 2 sentences long, but it may be longer) to
safari_talk@xxxxxxxxxxxx
(Please include your UG name in the email.)

Every week someone will be chosen from the tips or comments submitted
to receive fun stuff from O'Reilly (T-shirts, book bags, or other
surprises). If a member of your user group is selected, your group
receives free gifts, too. Whatever the individual member receives, your
UG will get one, too, to give away at your next meeting, or use however
you see fit. Recipients--and their comments--will be announced in the
User Group Newsletter.

**Please use this special UG URL to sign up for the 14-day trial**
