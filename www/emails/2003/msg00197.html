Safari News
================================================
***&quot;Go On Safari&quot; Tip of the Week Winner--W. Jim Jordan, 
Nortel Linux Users Group
&quot;Books are like consultants.  The best of them help you, provided you
make the appropriate investments in identifying and using them. The
worst of them only waste your time and money.  When there are over 1600
titles to choose from, the selection process is often hit-and-miss.
You may wind up paying for something that tells you only a bit of what
you want to know, or you may wind up with a valuable resource.  Safari
aids you in that selection process by allowing you to search all of the
titles in its catalogue for relevant sections, while providing
immediate access to the full text of a small number of titles that you
hold on your virtual bookshelf.&quot;

You can also participate in this introductory program just for user
group members. To &quot;Go on Safari,&quot; any UG member who signs up for our
Safari 14-day free trial can send comments on their experiences, or
tips and tricks for how they used Safari  (it only needs to be 2
sentences long, but it may be longer) to safari_talk@xxxxxxxxxxxx
(Please include your UG name in the email.)

Every week someone will be chosen from the tips or comments submitted
to receive fun stuff from O'Reilly (T-shirts, book bags, or other
surprises). If a member of your user group is selected, your group
receives free gifts, too. Whatever the individual member receives, your
UG will get one, too, to give away at your next meeting, or use however
you see fit. Recipients--and their comments--will be announced in the
User Group Newsletter.

***Five Habits for Successful Regular Expressions
For many programmers, writing regular expressions is a black art. They
stick to the features they know and hope for the best. Tony
Stubblebine, author of &quot;Regular Expression Pocket Reference,&quot; says
programmers can avoid a lot of trial and error by adopting these five
habits for regular expression development. The code examples in this
article use Perl, PHP, and Python, but the advice Tony espouses is
applicable to nearly any regex implementation.

***Globalizing and Localizing Windows Applications, Part 1
With the explosive growth of the Internet and rapid globalization of
the world's economies, the earth is getting smaller and smaller. The
applications that you develop for a local market may soon be used in
another country. If the world used a common language, that would make
the life of developers much easier. However, reality is far from
perfect. Wei-Meng Lee shows you how to make your applications ready for
the global marketplace.
