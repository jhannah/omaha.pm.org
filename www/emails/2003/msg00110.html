Here's a good, quick little rundown of backticks vs. system().

(Though you might want to look at File::Copy instead of forking cp to
the command line, and you might want to open() a file instead of forking
cat to the command line.)

Question:
What's wrong with using backticks in a void context?

    Strictly speaking, nothing. Stylistically speaking, it's not a good
    way to write maintainable code because backticks have a
    (potentially humungous) return value, and you're ignoring it. It's
    may also not be very efficient, because you have to read in all the
    lines of output, allocate memory for them, and then throw it away.
    Too often people are lulled to writing:

        `cp file file.bak`;

    And now they think &quot;Hey, I'll just always use backticks to run
    programs.&quot; Bad idea: backticks are for capturing a program's
    output; the system() function is for running programs.

    Consider this line:

        `cat /etc/termcap`;

    You haven't assigned the output anywhere, so it just wastes memory
    (for a little while). Plus you forgot to check `$?' to see whether
    the program even ran correctly. Even if you wrote

        print `cat /etc/termcap`;

    In most cases, this could and probably should be written as

        system(&quot;cat /etc/termcap&quot;) == 0
            or die &quot;cat program failed!&quot;;

    Which will get the output quickly (as its generated, instead of
    only at the end) and also check the return value.

    system() also provides direct control over whether shell wildcard
    processing may take place, whereas backticks do not.

   When I first began the Perl FAQ in the late 80s, I never realized it
   would have grown to over a hundred pages, nor that Perl would ever
   become so popular and widespread. This document could not have been
   written without the tremendous help provided by Larry Wall and the
   rest of the Perl Porters.
