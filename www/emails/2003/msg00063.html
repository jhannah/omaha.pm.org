&gt; I'm still voting for the Old Chicago on Cass -- they finally have Leine's

I think the votes of people who came to the last meeting should be
weighted more heavily. -poke- -grin- It is awfully loud there. Perhaps
the one on West Maple out on the patio would be better from a noise
perspective? I've been looking forward to BerryWeise. Somehow I never
got around to it last season. Is it back yet?

In less than four months I've gone from newbie to most active member to
leader in waiting to leader to democratic chairman to benevolent
dictator to evil despot. The very low volume of activity of this group
has left a power vacuum that has consumed me. I am flush with the
maniacal omnipotence that has sprung forth from absolute power. Indeed,
I must be stopped.

&gt; &quot;There are no Perl Mongers in Omaha. Never!&quot;

-laugh-  I'm safe until I get a few U.N. resolutions stacked up against
me and/or I throw the inspectors out. Remember the movie Running Man? My
IM will have to wear one of those collars so I'm sure he can't run off
and turn state's evidence. Are you man enough? -grin-

&gt; The second rule is that you WILL NOT TALK ABOUT Perl Mongers!!

Except on the mailing list, on the web site, and at meetings, right? 
-ponder- 

We have 30-ish people lurking on the list without a single post. Can
they be trusted? Perhaps #!/usr/bin/perl tattoos are in order to show
solidarity. Kent (and his employer) will love that. Maybe we can let
Kent get a C:\Perl\bin\perl tattoo instead? -grin-
