Ahh... Another new book!

&quot;'Learning Perl Objects, References &amp; Modules' picks up where Learning
Perl leaves off.&quot; 

&quot;Learning Perl&quot; was my first &quot;real&quot; programming book, back in 1992/1993.
A great, gentle introduction into Perl, and the only book I needed for
the first several years. It's great to see a &quot;Learning Perl&quot; style
extension into some of the more difficult aspects of our eclectit
language.

(That and more below.)

***Essential CVS

&quot;Essential CVS&quot; shows you how to apply order, using CVS, to the task of
managing large quantities of documents, code, web site content, and
more. The book covers basic concepts and usage of CVS, and features a
comprehensive reference for CVS commands. You'll also find advanced

***Learning Perl Objects, References &amp; Modules
Order Number: 4788
&quot;Learning Perl Objects, References &amp; Modules&quot; picks up where &quot;Learning
Perl&quot; leaves off. The book offers a gentle introduction to the world of
references, object-oriented programming, and the use of Perl modules.
Like &quot;Learning Perl,&quot; each chapter in &quot;Learning Perl Objects&quot; is
designed to be small enough to be read in an hour or two, and each ends
with exercises to practice what you've learned. This book covers
everything that separates the Perl dabbler from the Perl programmer.

&quot;Java Web Services in a Nutshell&quot; is a high-speed tutorial to the
technologies Sun Microsystems is creating to implement web services
with Java. This book offers a succinct introduction and a handy
reference to the Java/XML APIs, more commonly known as the Java Web
Services Development Pack. Filled with practical information, the book
provides Java developers with everything they need to know to use J2EE
APIs for web services, as well as to program with JAX-RPC.

***Packaged Composite Applications
Order Number: 5520
&quot;Packaged Composite Applications&quot; is the result of a systematic search
through the brain trust of SAP for all of the relevant arguments,
examples, concepts, and analogies related to Packaged Composite
Applications (PCAs). The book combines the approach of a
forward-looking analyst with the perspective of an executive who must
make things work, without skimping on the relevant technical details.
Learn about the ideas driving PCAs forward in the marketplace, and the
problems and solutions that executives and technologists will encounter
in implementation.  <a  href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pkgcompaps/">http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pkgcompaps/</a>


***Linux Security Cookbook
Order Number: 3919
&quot;Linux Security Cookbook&quot; is a system saver. It includes real solutions
to a wide range of targeted problems, such as sending encrypted email
within Emacs, restricting access to network services at particular
times of day, firewalling a web server, preventing IP spoofing, setting
up key-based SSH authentication, and much more. With over 150
ready-to-use scripts and configuration files, this unique book helps
administrators secure their systems without having to look up specific
syntax.

General News

***Sun, O'Reilly, and CollabNet Partner to Develop java.net
On June 10 at JavaOne, Sun Microsystems announced the doors are now
open at java.net, a site designed in partnership with O'Reilly &amp;
Associates and CollabNet to be the ultimate watering hole for
developers to share ideas, source code, documentation, and other
development work based on Java technology.  <a  href="http://www.java.net/">http://www.java.net/</a>

O'Reilly is also producing technical content for the site in the form
of a community newspaper for Java developers called Java Today.

***A Musician's Take on File Sharing, DRM, and Copyleft Licensing
Musicans can be a very adaptable community, and many are looking at
online music and file sharing differently than the companies that often
contract with them. Miriam Rainsford explores issues of P2P, DRM, and
copyleft licensing from her musician point of view.

***ETech 2003 Stories
This year's ETech was a whirlwind of provocative ideas, mind-bending
technological innovations, and great conversations. Tim O'Reilly offers
his favorite moment and wants to hear about yours. And for more
intellectual stimulation, don't miss O'Reilly's next convention--it all
kicks off July 7 at OSCON 2003.

***O'Reilly Book Sales Expectations
How many copies of your book could you expect to sell as an O'Reilly
author? How long would it take, and how much money would you bring in?
Tim talks about what you can expect if you write for O'Reilly in his
latest &quot;Ask Tim.&quot;

***Running Arbitrary Scripts Under CVS
CVS includes several hooks to integrate with other tools, such as bug
and project tracking. Jennifer Vesperman demonstrates how to expand CVS
to meet your needs, using Bugzilla as an example.

Java

***JSP Progress Bars
As web interfaces become ubiquitous, more and more complex back-end
processing is necessary. Of course, stateless HTTP leaves few ways to
tell users what's going on. Andrei Cioroianu presents a JSP technique
to display application &quot;progress bars.&quot;
<a  href="http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/06/11/jsp_progressbars.html">http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/06/11/jsp_progressbars.html</a>

.NET
---------------------
***Using Regular Expressions and XML Classes to Parse Your Log Files
Most systems these days can generate log files to store activity of the
system. What about when you are asked to transform all that data into
usuable information? Roy Osherove shows you how to use regular
expressions and .NET's XML classes to turn your log files into a
DataSet to allow you to search, sort, or report on your data
<a  href="http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2003/06/09/parsinglogs.html">http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2003/06/09/parsinglogs.html</a>

---------------------
XML
---------------------
***Visualizing XSLT in SVG
XSLT stylesheets can rapidly become difficult to understand for anyone
but their original author. By using XSLT on itself, this article
demonstrates how to create a diagram explaining the flow of control
within a stylesheet.  
<a  href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/06/04/xslt-svg.html">http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/06/04/xslt-svg.html</a>

***Deadline for Second Innovators Contest Nears
The deadline for the second Mac OS X Innovators Contest is fast
approaching: Monday, June 16, 2003. So polish up that software and
enter today.

***Knowing When to Let Go: Better Living Through Memory Management
The basic idea of memory management is to keep objects around exactly
as long as they're needed. In this article Rob Rix helps you learn how
to keep objects around for as long as they are needed, but no longer.
<a  href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2003/06/10/memory_mgmt.html">http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2003/06/10/memory_mgmt.html</a>
