[ Hey John Pritchard -- remember me, your intern circa 1993/1994? This
email is reminiscing about Perl from days of yore, so I've copied you
hoping you're still out there. -grin- -Jay Hannah ]

&gt; I was just checking through the pm.org site and saw the omaha.pm has
&gt; been 'resurected'.  :)   My name is Jeff Bisbee and I'm the
&gt; SouthFlorida.pm group leader (<a  href="http://southflorida.pm.org">http://southflorida.pm.org</a>).  I'm also
&gt; working on this year's YAPC conference @ Florida Atlantic University in
&gt; Boca Raton, FL.

Nice to meet you Jeff! I won't be able to make it YAPC, but am heading
out to OSCON this year. I've never been there, so I'm pretty excited. 

&gt; I grew up in Omaha and went to the University of Nebraksa at Omaha and
&gt; figured I could help the group out.  I was googling the other day and
&gt; found this post:
&gt; 
&gt;     <a  href="http://omaha.pm.org/emails/1998-2002/msg00007.html">http://omaha.pm.org/emails/1998-2002/msg00007.html</a>

Ahh, Google. Amazing stuff, that. I thought it would be good for
posterity to MHonArc *all* the old emails. -grin-

I'm an Omaha transplant myself. I was born in Missouri, then moved to
western Canada, Detroit, Iowa, South Dakota, before landing here about 6
years ago and growing. Nice digs, Omaha. 

&gt; I also would like to thank Matt Payne for &quot;showing me the path&quot; so long
&gt; ago.  Back in 1995 I was attempting my first web stuff and ran all over
&gt; UNO's campus with everyone telling me to take a hike (because I was
&gt; bugging the hell out of everyone by asking vauge questions).  This
&gt; search led me to Matt's office where he gave me a temporary account on
&gt; his personal Linux box under his desk gave me some great advice.  He
&gt; basically told me to read as much as I could, grab everything I could
&gt; get my hands on, then I ran into a specific question, ask it, get the
&gt; answer, then keep on reading.  I passed that lesson on many times and as
&gt; I reflect, it was some of the best advice I've ever gotten.

I have to give credit to a gentleman named John Pritchard in Sioux City
Iowa for giving me my start. I had been messing around w/ MS-DOS and
BBSs for years, but knew diddle about &quot;real programming.&quot; I asked him
what language I should learn, and he pointed me at Perl. 10 years later
I'm still using the blazes out of it. It has served me very well in my
career(s) to date and is still my favorite language. Thanks, John!

&gt; BTW, you might find mailman to be better than majordomo (yes I know that

We use Mailman at work. This list is amazingly quiet, so I'm really not
motivated to change anything. This list is mainly for me to talk to
myself about Perl while 35 people lurk. -grin-

Congrats on the wedding/house/etc! Ship me a palm tree, wouldya? (I
killed my last one. -sigh-)
