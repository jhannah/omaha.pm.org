Subject: Daily Perl FAQ - How can I hide the source for my Perl program?

Question:
How can I hide the source for my Perl program?

    Delete it. :-) Seriously, there are a number of (mostly
    unsatisfactory) solutions with varying levels of ``security''.

    First of all, however, you *can't* take away read permission,
    because the source code has to be readable in order to be compiled
    and interpreted. (That doesn't mean that a CGI script's source is
    readable by people on the web, though, only by people with access
    to the filesystem) So you have to leave the permissions at the
    socially friendly 0755 level.

    Some people regard this as a security problem. If your program does
    insecure things, and relies on people not knowing how to exploit
    those insecurities, it is not secure. It is often possible for
    someone to determine the insecure things and exploit them without
    viewing the source. Security through obscurity, the name for hiding
    your bugs instead of fixing them, is little security indeed.

    You can try using encryption via source filters (Filter::* from
    CPAN), but crackers might be able to decrypt it. You can try using
    the byte code compiler and interpreter described below, but
    crackers might be able to de-compile it. You can try using the
    native-code compiler described below, but crackers might be able to
    disassemble it. These pose varying degrees of difficulty to people
    wanting to get at your code, but none can definitively conceal it
    (this is true of every language, not just Perl).

    If you're concerned about people profiting from your code, then the
    bottom line is that nothing but a restrictive licence will give you
    legal security. License your software and pepper it with
    threatening statements like ``This is unpublished proprietary
    software of XYZ Corp. Your access to it does not give you
    permission to use it blah blah blah.'' We are not lawyers, of
    course, so you should see a lawyer if you want to be sure your
    licence's wording will stand up in court.

CREDITS
   When I first began the Perl FAQ in the late 80s, I never realized it
   would have grown to over a hundred pages, nor that Perl would ever
   become so popular and widespread. This document could not have been
   written without the tremendous help provided by Larry Wall and the
   rest of the Perl Porters.
