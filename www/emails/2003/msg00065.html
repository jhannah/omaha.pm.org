&gt;&gt;Is it back yet? 
Yep! Spirit World had three cases of it. Notice the *had*.

Old Chicago on West Maple is fine. Upstream is fine. Zios is fine. Hell,
even the Cresent Moon would be fine.

So, where?

I think the votes of people who came to the last meeting should be weighted
more heavily. -poke- -grin- It is awfully loud there. Perhaps the one on
West Maple out on the patio would be better from a noise perspective? I've
been looking forward to BerryWeise. Somehow I never got around to it last
season. Is it back yet?

In less than four months I've gone from newbie to most active member to
leader in waiting to leader to democratic chairman to benevolent dictator to
evil despot. The very low volume of activity of this group has left a power
vacuum that has consumed me. I am flush with the maniacal omnipotence that
has sprung forth from absolute power. Indeed, I must be stopped.

&gt; &quot;There are no Perl Mongers in Omaha. Never!&quot;

-laugh-  I'm safe until I get a few U.N. resolutions stacked up against me
and/or I throw the inspectors out. Remember the movie Running Man? My IM
will have to wear one of those collars so I'm sure he can't run off and turn
state's evidence. Are you man enough? -grin-

&gt; The second rule is that you WILL NOT TALK ABOUT Perl Mongers!!

Except on the mailing list, on the web site, and at meetings, right? 
-ponder- 

We have 30-ish people lurking on the list without a single post. Can they be
trusted? Perhaps #!/usr/bin/perl tattoos are in order to show solidarity.
Kent (and his employer) will love that. Maybe we can let Kent get a
C:\Perl\bin\perl tattoo instead? -grin-
