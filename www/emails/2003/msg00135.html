I've updated the web site (<a  href="http://omaha.pm.org/">http://omaha.pm.org/</a>): Next Meeting: July
17th @ 7pm. Location TBD. Kent Tegels is currently taking suggestions
for presentation topics. Please post your interests to the list.

(I assume that date works for most people.)

&gt; First, let's have a big round of applause for Jay for his great Perl
&gt; OOP presentation last night. Way to go, Jay!

Thanks. For those of you who weren't there, I'm going to whine one more
time before I stop apologizing:

- All 3 projectors at my work were spoken for for 7pm. Very rare (and a
bad omen of A/V disasters to come?). THANK YOU, Chris, for borrowing a
projector from work and letting me come grab it.
- I showed up @ Mojo's @ 6:35, and the doors were locked. Management @
Mojo's forgot we were coming. After incessant knocking, a gal who was
cleaning the store finally came and opened up for me. After calls to the
managers, the owner came down. 
- I started plugging in presentation stuff, with intermittant power
outages. 2 power strips, 3 outlets, and 1 relocation of equipment later:
apparently my extension cord I brought from home was bad. Ack!
- Now the laptop I brought from work doesn't function: the keyboard is
not responding once Windows 2000 starts booting. Apparently it was
working *the same afternoon* before I borrowed it, but a guy at work had
to completely rebuild Windows 2000 on Friday before the keyboard would
function again. Not a hardware problem after all! (Thanks, Bill. Grrr!)
- THANK YOU to Kent (&quot;Super Man&quot;) Tegels who ran home and got another
laptop. The presentation started around 7:45(?) from a copy I brought on
a floppy. While Kent was gone we occupied ourselves with miscellaneous
Perl subjects on a whiteboard I had brought from work. 

OK, I'm done humbly apologizing now. I hope people found the
presentation worthwhile. If nothing else, it gave me/us a better feel
for the Mongers in attendance, their various skill levels and interests,
and what might be good scope for future presentations.

I posted the .ppt I gave here:
   <a  href="http://omaha.pm.org/presentations/">http://omaha.pm.org/presentations/</a>

&gt; Second, I offered to do the next presentation. I'm thinking about
&gt; &quot;Perl, XML and Databases.&quot; We'd have a quick levelset on XML, then
&gt; dive into ways to use Perl to work with XML. There was also a lot of
&gt; interested in working with databases, so I can throw some of that in.
&gt; Keep in mind that this might a bit Windows-centered since that's where
&gt; I live (e.g., I'd be using Perl XML packages and MSXML and data access
&gt; would probably be OLE-DB instead of DBI.) I love to see a presentation
&gt; on data access on Un*x-flavor-of-the-day at some point too.

Sounds great to me! 

Does July 17th work? Any thoughts on location? Jay Swackhamer w/ Reboot
The User on West Dodge has graciously offered to host future meetings in
his store: <a  href="http://www.RebootTheUser.com">http://www.RebootTheUser.com</a>

Cheers,
