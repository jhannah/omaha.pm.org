<pre>&gt;&gt; My personal issue is with 'my' variables.  The way they aren't quite 
&gt;&gt; real just bugs the bejezers out of me.  I still use em though.

&gt; Aren't quite real? How so?

They're not part of the symbol table.  I know, most people today 
probably don't even know what a symbol table is, and even if they do
they don't care.  And they work as they're supposed to, but it still
just bugs me.

&gt;&gt; Unless it makes my life easier, I'm not willing to step through the 
&gt;&gt; debugger to figure out the correct syntax to pass and receive data 
&gt;&gt; structures in Perl. [...]

&gt; Well, subs *always* get and return arrays. That's all there is to it. 
&gt; Things only get wacky if you want them too. [...]

Yes, but when you want to pass a hash, or a reference to a thingy, and
catch those correctly, I end up stepping through with the debugger.

That's one of my weaknesses, I've very seldom guessed the right
incantation for even the least complicated structure pass.  Not 
enough practice, or patience to try to work it out on paper first,
could have some bearing on my difficulties.  Of course the main 
reason I feel this way in the first place is due to my past years
of C/C++ programming.

&gt;&gt; use strict; perl -w; yada yada yada.  Great for anything of size; I 
&gt;&gt; generally ignore them; I'm lazy, and impatient.  I strive to keep 
&gt;&gt; my hubris at  bay; it hinders one's ability to learn from others.

&gt; But hubris is oh so satisfying. -grin- You can just hide it 
&gt; temporarily when humbly asking questions.

Ah, but then you must realize you have something to learn in advance;
most learning opportunities don't announce themselves as such :-)

&gt; I guess I just shoot for &quot;use strict&quot;, no globals, etc. because w/o 
&gt; fail tiny little programs grow bigger. Easier to head off the evil when 
&gt; the evil is small and squashable. Later it gets nastier and more time 
&gt; consuming.

For those that do grow, yes, it is better to start off right. For the 
little utilities that are nice to string together on a command line,
they're generally much less likely to grow into anything sizable.

&gt;&gt;&gt; - Why is it called &quot;f&quot;? Why not &quot;f.pl&quot;? Gotta give props to the Perl
&gt;&gt;&gt; deities, ya know. Good karma.

&gt;&gt; 'Cause it's 3 characters shorter.

&gt; Ooo... The dark side is strong in this one. -laugh-

Eh, I'm not sure I fall into either category. I'm not just a hacker, but
I'm also not a &quot;programmer&quot; in title, though I find that does make up
a fair amount of my daily activity at work. I'm a Senior Network Engineer;
unfortunately this title is quite ambiguous; for me it means I'm 
responsible for all the Routers, Switches, WAN links, DNS, DHCP, Firewalls,
Internet etc. for a relatively large network. I'm not responsible (thank
deity of choice) for anything dealing with the user authentication, email
infrastructure (exchange)... nearly anything that I might have to deal
with a traditional OS on; the exceptions being DNS, DHCP, and some
firewalls.  The good thing is that it's my choice what OS those services
run on.  (Well, I am part of a 6 person team, so its not just me that
makes those decisions.)

So, it is in this capacity that I look around and go &quot;Ooo, I could write
a script that would make this tedious task less tedious!&quot; Then go about
writing it. So, my stuff is just a bunch of tools, once I get them to
work, I leave 'em alone generally. Thus, for me its not as important to
ensure that the things are written as cleanly as possible. And really,
once the thing works, I tend to just think of it as another command
available under *NIX, and start forgetting to tack on the '.pl' part.
So, although 'f' did start out as 'f.pl', it was through this process
that I dropped the '.pl'.

I have perl/expect routines to change passwords and community strings
on nearly all our heterogeneous network equipment, routines to backup
the configurations of these boxes, routines to watch for latency 
problems, routines to comb through syslog information, plus lots of
little tiny scripts that make my life just a bit easier.

Some of the larger scripts would probably benefit from use of the -w
or use strict, but then I'd have to spend the time to clean them up
rather than working on the next cool tool :)

BTW in today's email environment, why does it take you a week to
respond to this list?  Just curious.
