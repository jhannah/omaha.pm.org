Safari News
================================================
***&quot;Go On Safari&quot; Tip of the Week Winner--Robert Kuropkat, 
Oakland Perl Mongers Group
&quot;I just wanted to say I am quite impressed with the service so far. It
seems you may have helped me finally solve a career long dilemma: How
to have my books in two places at the same time! Ever since I started
buying tech books I have wanted them both at work and at home.
Obviously, the idea of buying two copies of every thing, or lugging
them all back and forth each day was hardly appealing. Now, I can
access all my books online at work complete with searching, notes and
bookmarks, while keeping my print editions enshrined at home!&quot;

Your group can also participate in this introductory program just for
user group members. To &quot;Go on Safari,&quot; any of your members who sign up
for our Safari 14-day free trial can send comments on their
experiences, or tips and tricks for how they used Safari  (it only
needs to be 2 sentences long, but it may be longer) to
safari_talk@xxxxxxxxxxxx (Please include your UG name in the email.)

Every week someone will be chosen from the tips or comments submitted
to receive fun stuff from O'Reilly (T-shirts, book bags, or other
surprises). If a member of your user group is selected, your group
receives free gifts, too. Whatever the individual member receives, your
UG will get one, too, to give away at your next meeting, or use however
you see fit. Recipients--and their comments--will be announced in the
User Group Newsletter.
