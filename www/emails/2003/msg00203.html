&gt; Do you work w/ Eli Criffield? Say &quot;hi&quot; for me and tell him I got more
&gt; arrows yesterday so we can go target shooting whenever. -grin-

Yep, we're on the same floor.

&gt;&gt; I recently grabbed some code off the p5p list, and modified it for 
&gt;&gt; my own uses, and just finished posting it back to p5p.

&gt;Cool stuff! Here's $0.02 from the peanut gallery of my twisted noggin',
&gt;if you want it:

eh, why not :)

&gt;- What if you want a delimiter other than whitespace (the default
&gt;delimiter of Perl's split function)? You could add a -d option to
&gt;specify the delimiter, like &quot;cut&quot; allows you to do from the command
&gt;line. Further, you could allow the user to pass a regex into -d if they
&gt;want! Try that mojo w/ &quot;cut&quot;! -grin-

Yeah, I've got the user defined regex stuff in a 'rename' perl script...
I'd thought about adding that, but since I was throwing it together to
actually accomplish something I was working on at the time, and didn't
need that functionality, I didn't bother adding it.  Plus, since I 
wanted to throw it back out to the world, I'd already spent an extra
two hours cleaning it up, adding the usage cruft etc, after getting it
to work for my purposes.

Anyone else is welcome to add their own features :-)

&gt;- The program is only 100 lines long, and the use of globals is already
&gt;making me nervous. If the program gets much bigger, your global use of
&gt;@nfl and such is probably going to get really hard to maintain quickly.
&gt;I'd &quot;use strict;&quot; and return @nfl from your call to parse_field_list(),
&gt;etc.

If you get that nervous about globals, you're using the wrong language ;-)

My personal issue is with 'my' variables.  The way they aren't quite real
just bugs the bejezers out of me.  I still use em though.

Unless it makes my life easier, I'm not willing to step through the debugger
to figure out the correct syntax to pass and receive data structures in Perl.
Yeah, this one's easy @nfl=sub($field); but, for this short a thing, it ain't
worth it to me.

use strict; perl -w; yada yada yada.  Great for anything of size; I generally
ignore them; I'm lazy, and impatient.  I strive to keep my hubris at bay; it
hinders one's ability to learn from others.

&gt;- Wow. &quot;$#f&quot;. Ya know, I've been coding Perl for almost 10 years and
&gt;I've never used $# in an actual program. I don't know how I've gotten
&gt;away with that. -grin- I didn't even know what $# did until I was on a
&gt;chat room a few months ago. We can use this for a quiz for the other
&gt;Perl Monger lurkers out there to see if *they* know what it does. -evil
&gt;laugh-

It's a hell of a lot shorter than scalar(@array).

&gt;- Why is it called &quot;f&quot;? Why not &quot;f.pl&quot;? Gotta give props to the Perl
&gt;deities, ya know. Good karma.

'Cause it's 3 characters shorter.

&gt;- I love the magical &lt;&gt; operator! Seeing it used gives me warm fuzzies.
&gt;And I'm not even drunk. -grin-

&gt;Come on down to our next meeting Scott! You can borrow one of the club's
&gt;books and then stop posting to the mailing list and not come to the
&gt;meetings. *cough* *cough* See how subtle I am, gang? Have I mentioned
&gt;that J the Librarian wants the groups books back to recirculate them?
&gt;-grin-

I would like to, but IIRC, your next meeting is on Thursday; I'm on a
Thursday night bowling league.  So, if you have non-Thursday meetings,
I'll attempt to make it :-)

I am, however, planning to try to make the meeting with Jeff Bisbee;
unless it also falls on that Thursday.

-Scott
