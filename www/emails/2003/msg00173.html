<pre>Man, this one is way too easy. You want to buy Perl? Go here:
<a  href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ASPN_Perl/pricing_and_licensing.plex">http://www.activestate.com/Products/ASPN_Perl/pricing_and_licensing.plex</a>

ActiveState is happy to sell you a subscription to Perl (Software is a
service, remember?) for a mere $495. Per year. But you get TCL for free.
Sigh.

Next meeting is when/where?

Laugh...

I, too, am willing to offer commercial versions of Perl. For the paultry sum
of $1,000 (USD) per CPU you can purchase shrink-wrapped, commercial copies
of Perl from me. I will support Perl with the same diligence and customer
service that Microsoft offers for their products. Call 1-800-JAY-HELP to
listen to my &quot;waiting for the next available technician&quot; on hold music for
as long as you like.

(Sorry if that phone number doesn't work. I think our ACD is down, but will
be back up momentarily.)

Question:
Where can I buy a commercial version of Perl?

    In a sense, Perl already *is* commercial software: It has a licence
    that you can grab and carefully read to your manager. It is
    distributed in releases and comes in well-defined packages. There
    is a very large user community and an extensive literature. The
    comp.lang.perl.* newsgroups and several of the mailing lists
    provide free answers to your questions in near real-time. Perl has
    traditionally been supported by Larry, dozens of software designers
    and developers, and thousands of programmers, all working for free
    to create a useful thing to make life better for everyone.

    However, these answers may not suffice for managers who require a
    purchase order from a company whom they can sue should anything go
    wrong. Or maybe they need very serious hand-holding and contractual
    obligations. Shrink-wrapped CDs with perl on them are available
    from several sources if that will help.

    Or you can purchase a real support contract. Although Cygnus
    historically provided this service, they no longer sell support
    contracts for Perl. Instead, the Paul Ingram Group will be taking
    up the slack through The Perl Clinic. The following is a commercial
    from them:

    &quot;Do you need professional support for Perl and/or Oraperl? Do you
    need a support contract with defined levels of service? Do you want
    to pay only for what you need?

    &quot;The Paul Ingram Group has provided quality software development
    and support services to some of the world's largest corporations
    for ten years. We are now offering the same quality support
    services for Perl at The Perl Clinic. This service is led by Tim
    Bunce, an active perl porter since 1994 and well known as the
    author and maintainer of the DBI, DBD::Oracle, and Oraperl modules
    and author/co-maintainer of The Perl 5 Module List. We also offer
    Oracle users support for Perl5 Oraperl and related modules (which
    Oracle is planning to ship as part of Oracle Web Server 3). 20% of
    the profit from our Perl support work will be donated to The Perl
    Institute.&quot;

    For more information, contact the The Perl Clinic:

        Tel:    +44 1483 424424
        Fax:    +44 1483 419419
        Web:    <a  href="http://www.perl.co.uk/">http://www.perl.co.uk/</a>

CREDITS
   When I first began the Perl FAQ in the late 80s, I never realized it
   would have grown to over a hundred pages, nor that Perl would ever
   become so popular and widespread. This document could not have been
   written without the tremendous help provided by Larry Wall and the
   rest of the Perl Porters.
