&gt;Which I can't figure out.  Where did the T in 'This' go?  I finally
realized it had something to do with the newlines in the file.  I fixed it
by using &quot;$_ =~ s/\r\n//;&quot;  instead of &quot;chop;&quot;.   But what was going on?
The file did come from a windows system, so I thought maybe chop was just
pulling off the newline but not the CR? So I tried chomp, chomp;chomp;, and
chop;chop; but nothing helped.

Unix uses \n (0x0D - ascii 13 - \cJ - linefeed) at the end of lines. 
Windows and terminals use \r \n ( 0x0A - ascii 10 - \cM - carriage return,
0x0D - ascii 13 - \cJ - linefeed) The old mac operating system uses just
\r, but I don't know what the new operating system does. Newline is just a
figment of our collective imagination, and doesn't really exist at all. 

When your Perl program reads in a binary windows file, it reads in /cM/Cr,
but that's converted to just a linefeed, and the program thinks it's
actually read in one more byte than it has. 

The carriage return moves the working point to the beginning of the line,
and then the newline moves it down a line. You were losing the &quot;T&quot; because
you removed the newline, but the carriage return was still there, and he
moved the working point to the beginning of the line in cahoots with
dragons to get rid of the T, which went out with his wife in highschool and
she still talks about him sometimes.  Or something like that. 

Chomp removes the newline, but won't remove the \r. Chop removes whatever
the last character in the string might be. You need to remove both
characters. 
Chop(chomp($your_string_here)) might work or it might not, (as you can see,
my mind is elsewhere today) but I personally would chomp;s \ / \r \ / \n
/;chomp, although chop is supposed to be more efficient. Chomp won't send
anything to the dragons but a newline which doesn't exist, while chop
doesn't care what it sends. 

I don't generally run into this because I when I upload windows files I
want to read as text, I either upload them as ascii text , not binaries, or
use binmode and the operating system sends the carriage return to the
dragons and that's an alternate universe anyway, and I don't think carriage
return is even married there. 

I think there's something about this in the Perl Cookbook under processing
binary files. Probably makes more sense than I do.
