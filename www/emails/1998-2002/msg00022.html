<pre>I received this e-mail from a friend, and was inspired by the guy who
wrote a C program to find the solution.  So, I sat down to write a perl
doohickey to do the same, and got about as far as...

#!/usr/local/bin/perl


But hey, I don't really want to work for bill anyway right? :)
However, the problem intrigued me, and I'm more than sure it's possible.

Any Ideas?

&gt; Rumor has it that this is one of the questions for potential employees
&gt; for Microsoft.  Incidentally, Microsoft is the only company that has
&gt; made it public knowledge that I.Q. is one of the criteria for selection.
&gt; Reportedly, one guy solved it by developing and compiling a
&gt; program in C in 37 minutes, it ran on the first try.  Another guy
&gt; solved it in less than a minute.  A group of 50 at Motorola could not
&gt; figure it at all. Microsoft expects the applicants to solve it in five
&gt; minutes of less.
&gt; 
&gt; See how long it takes you.
&gt; 
&gt; The Beatles have a concert that starts in 17 minutes, and
&gt; they must all cross a rickety bridge to get from where they are to the
&gt; concert.  All four men begin on the same side of the bridge.  You must
&gt; help them get to the other side.
&gt; 
&gt; It is night, and there is only one flash light.  A maximum of
&gt; two people can cross at one time.  Any party who crosses, either one or
&gt; two men, must have the flashlight with them at all times during the
&gt; crossing.  The  flashlight must be walked back and forth, it cannot be
&gt; tossed, thrown,  etc.  Each band member walks at a different speed.  A
&gt; pair must walk  together at the rate of the slower man's pace.
&gt; 
&gt; John: 1 minute to cross
&gt; Paul: 2 minutes to cross
&gt; George: 5 minutes to cross
&gt; Ringo: 10 minutes to cross
&gt;
&gt; For example:  If Paul and Ringo cross at the same time, a total of 10
&gt; minutes will have elapsed by the time they get to the other side.  If
&gt; Ringo walks back with the flashlight, another 10 minutes will have
&gt; passed for a total of 20 minutes and you will have failed your
&gt; mission.
&gt; 
&gt; Note:
&gt; There are no tricks to this question.
&gt; There are 2 solutions.
