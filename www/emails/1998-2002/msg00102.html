<pre>As you can infer, we had a problem with the server that hosts all things
'monger' last week ... things are slowly coming back ... a rebuild from
tape backup was done on the web sites ... other things are being
re-built and re-configured as we speak. I hope the interruption to
service for this list wasn't too much of a burden! :) ... so *many*
messages sent and lost, I'm sure :)

Speaking of which, someone posted 10 days ago, or so, about having students ask
questions to this list. Well I tried to respond, but because of how I had it
configured, the majordomo thought I was asking an administrative question, and
didn't forward it to the list. When trying to modify the majordomo over the
weekend, I discovered that the host machine was down. Well I have since been
able to reset the configuration, so this email should now be able to get through
to the list. Just in case you're curious, the dirty word was I had in the
original email (and this one) was 'subscribe' ... the 'administrivia' feature in
majordomo saw this and said &quot;oh my! someone is trying to subscribe to the
discussion list ... I won't post it there, and instead I'll notify the list
owner of this silly mistake&quot;. So everytime I tried to post it it bounced. It
took me 3 attempts before I figured it out.

So I guess in a head-to-head, one-on-one clash of wits between me and a Perl
Script (which is what majordomo is), I uh .... ummmmmmmmmm ... come in second.

Yeah! That's the ticket ... I made it to the finals, and finished a respectable
second place!

Anyway, in response to Matt Arnold's post a week and a half ago, I wrote
(write):

&gt; I wouldn't mind fielding student questions on the mailing list.  It's pretty
&gt; low traffic, and this could help pep things up.  But Pat reserves the right

I do? :) Actually, anyone can subscribe to the mailing list. It *is*
'private', meaning you can't post to the group without being a
subscriber (and I think I'll leave it that way), but by all means,
please encourage all those interested in Perl, student or otherwise, to
subscribe ... and to post with abandon ... I too would enjoy fielding
questions, giving a presentation, etc, etc

You can forward the attached instructions for subscribing to whomever
you like. The same info can also be found by following the 'Omaha.pm
Mailing List' link found at <a  href="http://omaha.pm.org:">http://omaha.pm.org:</a>
