<h2>Status</h2>
<p>
The lastest status info is always here and on the "Interested Group Leaders" 
mailing list below. Or contact me
directly: Jay Hannah &lt;jay(at)jays(dot)net&gt; 1-402-578-3976.
<p>
<b>[2006-12-30]</b> I donated $128.11 to the Perl Foundation today. That was the overflow
on this whole project. 400 t-shirts ($4,209.45 USD after S&H), 28 groups in 7 countries.
Too cool. :)  Thanks, all! See you in 2008! Shutting down the shirts mailing list.
<p>
<b>[2006-10-25]</b> Holy buckets. International shipping ran several hundred dollars
higher than the worst case scenario I had feared. All actual shipping costs are now
in the XML file and the invoices.txt report is enhanced to show actual shipping 
and actual PayPal.
I sent a check for $4,209.45 to the shirt company tonight.
<p>
<b>[2006-09-26]</b> All shirts have shipped! 4 groups have received their
orders so far (Germany was the first to receive! Go figure. -grin-). 
Everything looking good. Once I get the actual shipping costs
(this week?) I'll add them to the XML. Ditto on the VAT taxes 
for non-US groups (2-3 weeks from now).<p>
<b>[2006-09-04]</b> Shirt quantites and colors locked in. The order has
been handed over to the printer/shipper.<p>
<b>[2006-08-24]</b> Payment deadline is Aug 31. On that date any group that has not paid will be removed from the order. Looks like I have received $1700. 
$1500 is still outstanding. 3 or 4 groups have physical checks in the mail
to me.<p>
<b>[2006-08-17]</b> Last night (yikes, I was up until 2am!) I got the XML
stuff all set (Ronald J Kimball is da bomb!) and the reports roughed out.
8am candidate interview this morning... Sleep is for the weak! :) 
We're in the money phase now. I'm trying to keep up with the data entry 
and special requests and the printer's needs. International issues are
the weakest chink in my armor -- I'm failing to predict shipping and PayPal
fees with extreme efficiency. :) No one is screaming at me, so I guess
I'm not being <b>too</b> slow. The best news is that IMHO I'm getting
a hell of a cool system for future orders working here...<p>

<b>[2006-08-02]</b> Well, we're starting to get our bearings on the order
size. 95 shirts on the books so far. I'll send this list off to our vendor
so he knows what he got himself into and maybe he can put some S&H numbers
together for the groups that have their preliminary counts in. I'll also
pin him down on toddler sizes (sorry for the delay, I've been sick).<p>

<b>[2006-07-08]</b> Firing up another order! Luckily the company
still has our screen on file so we save $150 setup or something. 
The printer is saying that Hanes Beefy shirts are a lot more expensive now, so
he'll be quoting me those and some other quality equivalent (but cheaper). The printer
is also saying their shipping cost is quite a bit higher than it was 2 years ago.
I personally ate the shipping costs last time, maybe we'll figure something else 
out this time. :)
<p>
I'm sending to an email announcement to Omaha.pm mailing list, and to the Perl Mongers
group leader mailing list (all group leaders around the world). Each group leader 
(if any groups are interested) will need to organize their group's orders and work
out payment with their members however they want to handle that.
Once we've got our total order pieced together each group leader will pay me,
I'll pay the grand total bill on my personal credit card, and instruct the printer 
to drop ship directly to each group leader.

<h2>The Order</h2>

<b>
2006-08-08: Shirt count cut off<br>
2006-08-31: Payment cut off
</b>

<blockquote>
   <a href="shirts/2006.xml">2006.xml</a> - the data<br>
   <a href="shirts/invoices.txt">invoices.txt</a> - for group leaders<br>
   <a href="shirts/production.txt">production.txt</a> - for the printer<br>

   <a href="http://vc.jays.net/viewvc.cgi/shirts/reports.pl?root=omaha.pm.org&view=log">[source code]</a> - for the geeks
</blockquote>

<h2>Brand / Colors</h2>
All shirts are Hanes Beefy-Ts.
<P>
Based on past experience, only these two choices are popular enough to 
bother with:
<ul>
<li>"BLACK": white print on black shirt
<li>"ASH": black print on ash (grey) shirt
</ul>
The printer will do a million color combinations, but they charge $20 or something every time they have to change color setup during their print run.
So unless someone drums up enough interest for another scheme (perhaps navy on white? black on white?) we'll stick with the two above. 

<h2>Sizes / Prices</h2>

These are <b>rough guidelines only</b>. I'm doing the best I can to provide
as much info as possible as quickly as I have it on shifting sands. 
Probably best to round up by a dollar or two 
if you're penny pinchy. :)
<P>
Final quote to each group will fluctuate based on:
<ul>
<li>Total quantity ordered by all groups. As our total count grows, our
price per shirt drops.
<li>Color. Ash is ~ $0.60 USD cheaper per shirt depending on size. The
prices below are my most recent quote for black.
<li>If anyone wants any youth shirts someone will have to eat a one time
$20 USD setup fee.
<li>Each group will have to pay for shipping from the printer, which they 
will quote "at cost". They ship via United Postal Service (UPS).
(So obviously the effective cost for each shirt varies based on how many
shirts your group orders and how far your group is from MA, USA.)
</ul>

Feel free to throw in donations to the Perl Foundation and I'll pass those along.

<h2>Interested Group Leaders</h2>

You are all on a temporary email mailing list: shirts(at)jays(dot)net

<pre>
   See the XML file above (under "The Order"). Every email address
   listed in there is on this list, plus other random people that 
   expressed interest at any point in time.
</pre>

<h2>Image / Trademark Info</h2>

<pre>
> Is the design available electronically, and
> would it be free for me to use that design, copyright-wise?
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
The artwork (JPG): 
   <a href="shirts/artwork_thumb.jpg">16KB</a> thumbnail, 
   <a href="shirts/artwork.jpg">1MB</a> "high res"
<li> The camel is <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/lpt/a/3157">an O&#39;Reilly trademark</a>. 
<li> The onion is <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl_trademark">a Perl Foundation trademark</a>. 
<li>I have asked for and received camel and onion permissions in the past. All of that info is 
<a href="http://omaha.pm.org/kwiki/index.cgi?BusinessCards">on the Omaha Perl Mongers wiki</a>.
</ul>

We're riding the coattails of a screen that was set up years ago (circa 1996!?) at the printing company below. 
I do not have specific permission to use these logos for these shirts, I'm assuming that permission was granted years ago when the first screen was established for the first print run. 
<p> 
AFAIK neither O'Reilly nor The Perl Foundation have ever asked anyone for 
any fee to use their trademarks for non-profity stuff like these shirts.

<h2>For Future Reference</h2>

These are the nice folks that keep printing our shirts every couple of years.
They'll keep the screen on file for two years after each order.
Getting the screen generated is a big cost of 
getting shirts printed, so them having the screen already on file is a big
cost saver.

2006-08-19 per Mike: 
All Star considers shirt orders < 144 shirts to be too small
for their operation. He suggested that for smaller orders we could contact their
production partner in Worcester, Mass.:
