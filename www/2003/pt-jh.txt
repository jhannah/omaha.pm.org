Hello Jay ...

How would you like to take over the Omaha Perl Mongers?  You would have 
a shell account on omaha.pm.org for secure shell / FTP access, you would 
  have the web site to play around with, and the mailing list to manage 
(which has been incredibly easy, since a message hadn't been posted for 
over a year :)

Let me know if you're interested ... if not, I'll post to the group and 
see if anyone else might be interested

Thanks,

Pat

Sure, I can give a term in office a whirl. Is there a swearing in or
knighting ceremony of some kind? -grin-

If we get organized I hope you can come to the meetings! I'd hate to
miss meeting you. We'll have to put up a Hall of Honor for Past
Presidents...

I promise to defend the honor of Omaha.pm, and make you proud! -grin-

Cheers,

Jay Hannah

Sure there's a swearing in:

Dammit Jay, take over! :)

The future of the free and open source world is in your hands.

I will work on getting things shifted over to you at omaha.pm.org ... 
this will probably take a few days, based on how busy the sys admin is 
... he's a good guy, though

I'll be in touch

Pat

The "Omaha Perl Mongers" group needs some new life.  To that end, Jay 
Hannah will be taking over all things monger-related in Omaha.

We are in the process of getting the omaha.pm.org web-site and this 
mailing list transferred over to him.

The rule of law has prevailed.  A peaceful transition has enveloped the 
threat of mayhem and bloodshed.

God Bless America, and God Bless the Omaha Perl Mongers!

Pat
