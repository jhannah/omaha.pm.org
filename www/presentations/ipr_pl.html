<h1>Bug Hunt: Jay's IP Optimum Bitmask Thingy</h1>

If you're familiar with and interested in IP subnet calculators, you may
find one I wrote in 2000 worth a look:

If you're interested in Perl and/or bug hunting and/or the mathematics 
behind IP subnet calculators (at least the way I did it) 
you may find it interesting
that there's a bug in my script: 
<p>

The optimum bitmask for the IP range 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.63.255 is 10.0.0.0/18, 
but my script reports 2 /19 networks instead:

<blockquote>
<a href="http://jays.net/cgi-bin/ipr.pl?ip1=10.0.0.0&ip2=10.0.63.255">http://jays.net/cgi-bin/ipr.pl?ip1=10.0.0.0&ip2=10.0.63.255</a>
</blockquote>

Where's the bug? Beats me. I haven't taken the time to try and find it yet.
Since I'm looking for another Perl Mongers topic anyway, I figured I demo 
the Perl debugger. Perhaps as part of that demo I'll try to delve into the
inner workings of this script and find the buggy.
<p>

Here's the source code (my CVS is broken):

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

If you want to beat me to it, feel free to post your solution to the Omaha
Perl Mongers mailing list.
<p>

Enjoy! (Or ignore! -grin-)
