<b>Status: [05/13/2004]</b> Hmm... I just emailed the printing company and Jeff
because our order hasn't arrived yet and they said we'd have them by 5/7.<br>
<b>Status: [03/25/2004]</b> Tweaked Sidney's order. What's our 
status Jeff? Are you placing the order soon or what?<br>
<b>Status: [02/21/2004]</b> Tweaked a couple orders per emails. Wrote summary program (source code link below). Jeff says he will send me the SouthFlorida order count so I will keep the master list. He's working through the ink-change issue.<br>
<b>Status: [02/15/2004]</b> Tweaked Brian Wiese's order for him. I don't think it's too late.<br>
<b>Status: [02/14/2004]</b> Jeff is placing the order any day now (maybe yesterday),
so the order list is now final. Now it's just a question of getting money from
folks, getting the shirts to Omaha, and people picking them up. Jay (Omaha.pm) will
be paying Jeff (SouthFlorida.pm) one lump sum.
<p>
The last info is always on the Omaha.pm mailing list.

<h3>The Order</h3>
<blockquote>
Color preference is not guaranteed. We may have to order
one color for all shirts. (e.g. Minimum order for any color is 6 
shirts, so we'll have to trim colors that don't make that cut.)

<h3>For Future Reference</h3>

These are the nice folks that printed up the shirts. They'll keep the screen
on file for two years. Getting the screen generated is a big cost of 
getting shirts printed, so them having the screen already on file is a big
cost saver.

Hi Jay,

Glad to hear everything went smoothly.  Screens are typically kept for 2
years.  You should be fine to place an order next year.  Have a nice
weekend.
