 Hi Jay,
<p>
 In keeping with our agreement with Perl Mongers granting limited rights for use of O'Reilly's camel logo, we approve your request for use of the camel logo on your business cards, letterhead and envelopes for non-commercial purposes.  
<p>
 Whenever the logo is used, there must be the Registered Trademark symbol ® (circled R) by the camel's back foot with the wording "Camel image is a Trademark of O'Reilly Media, Inc.  Used with permission." This attribution wording is shorter than the original wording and should fit more easily onto your business cards. 
<p>
 From looking at the Perl Monger site, it is my understanding that Smith and Jones Advertising and Marketing will be your contact for a large Perl Monger image suitable for your printing needs. I am sure someone at Perl Mongers, Inc. can provide you with their contact information.
<p>
 Best Regards,<br>
 Karen Arrington<br>
 Legal Department<br>
 O'Reilly Media, Inc.<br>
