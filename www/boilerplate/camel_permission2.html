Hi Jay,
<p>
Your business card design looks good.  (I like the squiggly lines, too.)
<p>
Until further notice, please have other PM groups who wish to use the camel logo contact us for permission.  We like to keep track of those who are using the camel and the grant of rights they were given.
<p>
Best Regards,<br>
Karen
